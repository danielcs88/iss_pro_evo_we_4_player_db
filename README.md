# ISS Pro Evolution (WE4) Player Database

This was the first game that truly captured me in PES. I recently bought an Ambernic RG35XX and rediscovered this beauty.

I decided to make a database of all the players in the game.

I have all the data hosted on Google Sheets which will probably be the best for everybody. I additionally hosted the entire database also on Vercel on top of Datasette, which enables querying the data visually and with SQL. Lastly, which is my preference, I am hosting this data as a Parquet file which is compatible with Python (Pandas), R, and Google Big Query.
