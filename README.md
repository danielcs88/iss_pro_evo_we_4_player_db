# ISS Pro Evolution (WE4) Player Database

![](https://i.imgur.com/J1AGINo.jpg)

This was the first game that truly captured me in PES. I recently bought an
Ambernic RG35XX and rediscovered this beauty.

I decided to make a database of all the players in the game.

I have all the data hosted on Google Sheets which will probably be the best for
everybody.

There is also a `.db` file which is accesible with Datasette or SQLite.

Lastly, which is my preference, I am hosting this data as a Parquet file which
is compatible with Python (Pandas), R, and Google Big Query.

## Data
